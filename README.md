An interactive Power BI dashboard analyzing the Big Mac Index to compare global burger prices and evaluate percentage differences against the USA benchmark.

This project demonstrates data modeling, DAX calculations, and business-focused dashboard design.

Analyze percentage differences vs USA

Filter dynamically by year and country
